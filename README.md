> This project was developed for the PlayLine Front-End code test, the idea is to replicate the layout that was made available and develop its functions as requested in the challenge. The Project was created in React using TypeScript and consumes information from a mock API provided in the code test.

# About the project

This project was built using the following technologies:

**React**
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**TypeScript**
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. It was used to make the treatment of the data returned by the api easier, in addition to helping the creation and use of components complementing the intellisense of vscode.

**Sass**
[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world. It was used to help to keep things organized and to create style sheets faster enabling things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more.

**Axios**
[Axios](https://axios-http.com/) is a simple promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. It was used to simplify the HTTP requests to the API.
